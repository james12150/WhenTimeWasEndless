The picture isn't as clearas when time was endless. 
Now softer edges, people always smiling. 
What was that again? 
When time was endless.

Had it by the tail.
Her, them, it.
Nothings gonna fail. 
More, too much, not enough. 
It's all on the rail.

I remember the time we made our big move. 
Everybody wanting me to steer.
It was a big scene, a big groove. 
Grab the brush, paint. Oh that mirror.

Eyes on it all. What a beautiful tree. 
Endless colors, lines, all sorts of things. 
But it's all slipping away in what was me.
Nothing is clear anymore. Softer edges, people always smiling.

I'm heading into the tabular rasa but
I know they won't fail. 
It's all there. What a beautiful picture. 
They got it by the tail.

Oh. Endless time.
